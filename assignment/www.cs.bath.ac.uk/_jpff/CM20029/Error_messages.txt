	These are some of the error messages produced by Apple's MPW C
compiler. These are all real. (If you must know I was bored one
afternoon and decompiled the String resources for the compiler.) The
compiler is 324k in size so these are just an excerpt I hope. I'm not
sure where I stand on the copyright issue.
