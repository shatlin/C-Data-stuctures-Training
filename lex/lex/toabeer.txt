Hi Abeer,
             The files are to be in three folders in c drive.
when you extract the code.zip it will give you three folders stack,treee,and twodarr.
Put these folders in c drive and run the program
           i have done these programs using Turbo c++.
       if u intend to keep these files in different location,then you have to change the directory in the headers.

for example I might have written
#include "c:\twodarr\twodarr.h".

change such lines as required.

In stack and tree programs,  I made provisions for each node to store either one integer or two integers.

In stack program, i used the twodarry abstract data type to store two integers in each node.

There are two test programs for Array program.

Any questions, just SMS me,009739266243
and we shall discuss it.Give me 1 hour to come online.I dont have net at home, I have to come to a net cafe .

Hope you find the codes easy to understand.

regards,
Shatlin Denistan.
