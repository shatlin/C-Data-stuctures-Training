The following example prepends line numbers to each line in a file. Some implementations of lex
predefine and calculate yylineno. The input file for lex is yyin, and defaults to stdin.
%{
int yylineno;
%}
%%
^(.*)\n printf("%4d\t%s", ++yylineno, yytext);
%%
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
yyin = fopen(argv[1], "r");
yylex();
fclose(yyin);
}
The definitions section is composed of substitutions, code, and start states. Code in the
definitions section is simply copied as-is to the top of the generated C file, and must be bracketed with “%{“ and “%}”  markers.
